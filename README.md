**TASK**

- Create a node app that implements a set of REST APIs allowing CRUD functionality for an employee resource.
- Add a front end component of your choosing. The front end component should:
  - Show a list of the existing employees
  - Include a way to create a new employee using the POST API

**Expected Time**

This exercise is expected to take about 4-5 hours total, over the course of 2-3 days.

**Submission Instructions**

Post your solution to a public repository on [Github](https://github.com/). Send the repository URL back to the same person who sent you these instructions.

**Additional Guidance**

Persistent storage is not necessary, just use an in memory object to track employee records.

Use any npm modules you find useful.

**Expected Endpoints**

POST http://localhost:3000/api/employees

- Create a new record using a randomly generated value as the unique identifier (i.e. _id field).  Validate that the following fields are included in the POST body and have the right type/format as posted below:
    - firstName (String)
    - lastName (String)
    - hireDate (YYYY-MM-DD format must be in the past)
    - role (String) - must be one of the following (case-insensitive):
        - CEO (can only be one of these)
        - VP
        - MANAGER
        - LACKEY

    - In addition to the fields included in the POST body, include two fields in each new record that are populated by different external APIs.  For example, a favorite joke and a favorite quote, or a favorite joke and a second favorite joke.  As long as the two external APIs are different.
        - Possible API endpoints:
